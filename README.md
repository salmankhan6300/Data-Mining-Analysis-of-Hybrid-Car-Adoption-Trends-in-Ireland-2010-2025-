**Project Overview**

This project analyzes vehicle registration data in Ireland to compare trends between hybrid and non-hybrid vehicles. The objective is to understand early hybrid vehicle adoption patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of different data mining and forecasting techniques.
The analysis focuses on the period 2006–2010 due to data availability constraints identified during exploratory data analysis. Multiple statistical and machine learning models are applied and compared using standard evaluation metrics.
Dataset

**Source: Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO)
Data Type: Monthly vehicle registration data
Key Attributes:***

Vehicle Category
Fuel Type
Registration Month and Year
Number of Registrations



**Data Mining Techniques Used**

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

Linear Regression (baseline model)
ARIMA (time-series forecasting)
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor

Model performance was evaluated using:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand:

Overall registration trends
Differences between hybrid and non-hybrid vehicles
Seasonal patterns in vehicle registrations
Distribution and variability of registration counts

**EDA techniques included:**

Line plots
Bar charts
Cumulative trend analysis
Heatmaps for seasonality detection

The insights gained from EDA informed model selection and justified the use of time-series and ensemble-based methods.
